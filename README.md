# NoSqlDatabase, C++, Visual Studio.

Purpose:

There is currently a lot of technical interest in "Big Data". Extreme examples are: data
collection and analyses from the Large Hadron Collider, the Sloan Sky Survey, analyses of Biological Genomes, measuring weather patterns, collecting data for global climate models, and analyzing client interactions in social networks.
Conventional SQL databases are not well suited for these kinds of applications. While they have worked very well for many business applications and record keeping, they get overwhelmed by massive streams of data. Developers are turning to "noSQL" databases like MongoDB, couchDB, Redis, and Big Table to handle massive data collection and analyses.
In this project I have created my own in momory key/value non SQL database.
